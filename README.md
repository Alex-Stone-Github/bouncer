# bouncer
---
This is my first project on github, just a little bouncing text ball, animation thingy, but, I think it's cool, so it will stay here.

## How to make
Simply, just use the **make** command to build the project, or if you want to be difficult you can use **gcc bouncer.c -o bouncer**.

```bash
make
```

or 

```bash
gcc bouncer.c -o bouncer
```


## How to run
Just use **make run** or **./bouncer** to run the application.
```bash
make run
```
or
```bash
./bouncer
```
